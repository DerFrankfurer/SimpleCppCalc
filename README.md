# Simple C++ Calculator

This is a simple cli based calculator implemented in C++ that allows performing basic arithmetic operations through the command line. The program takes a mathematical operation as a string, such as `3+4`, directly on the command line and displays the result in return.

## Supported Operations
The calculator supports the following operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you are going to need a C++ compiler. I used standard C++11, so any modern C++ compiler should work.

## Compilation

To compile the program, navigate to the directory where the source file is saved and run the following command:

g++ -std=c++11 calculator.cpp -o calculator
